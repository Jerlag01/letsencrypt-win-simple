# win-acme
This is a ACMEv2 client for Windows that aims to be very simple to start with, 
but powerful enough to grow into almost every scenario.

- A very simple text driven interface to create and install certificates on a local IIS server
- A more advanced text driven interface for many other use cases, including [Apache](/win-acme/manual/advanced-use/examples/apache) and [Exchange](/win-acme/manual/advanced-use/examples/exchange)
- Automatically creates a scheduled task to renew certificates when needed
- Get advanced certificates with wildcards (`*.example.com`), 
	international domain names (`证书.example.com`), 
	[OCSP Must Staple](/win-acme/reference/plugins/csr/rsa) extension, 
	optional [re-use](/win-acme/reference/plugins/csr/rsa) of private keys,
	[EC](/win-acme/reference/plugins/csr/ec) cryptography or 
	bring your own [custom CSR](/win-acme/reference/plugins/target/csr)
- Advanced toolkit for DNS, HTTP and TLS validation:
	[SFTP](/win-acme/reference/plugins/validation/http/sftp), 
	[FTPS](/win-acme/reference/plugins/validation/http/ftps),
	[WebDav](/win-acme/reference/plugins/validation/http/webdav),
	[acme-dns](/win-acme/reference/plugins/validation/dns/acme-dns),
	[Azure](/win-acme/reference/plugins/validation/dns/azure),
	[Route53](/win-acme/reference/plugins/validation/dns/route53) 
	and more...
- Completely unattended operation from the command line
- Other forms of automation through manipulation of `.json` files
- Write your own Powershell `.ps1` scripts to handle custom installation and validation
- Build your own plugins with C# and make the program do exactly what you want
